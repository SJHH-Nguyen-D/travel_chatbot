I finally have some vacation time starting on August 22nd and I am hoping to go away somewhere really far away and getting away from it all. Do you have any suggestions for me?\nWhere would you be leaving from and how long is your trip?\nI would be leaving from Sydney and I have to be back by Wednesday, September 7.  I am so excited!\nDo you have any destinations in mind?\nNot really. As long as it is within those dates, or even returning a bit earlier,  and also within my budget, I really do not care where I go. I am just happy to get out of Sydney for a while.\nGreat! I will see what I can do. What is your budget for this trip?\nI just got my big yearly bonus so I have $6100.00 to spend. Send me as far away as possible!\nCan I interest you in a 5 day 4 star package to Naples, a 9 day 5 star package in Berlin or an 8 day 3 star package in Manaus, Brazil?\nWhat are the dates for the Berlin package? A 5 star package sounds fantastic, as long as it is within my budget.\nYou would depart on Saturday, August 27th and return on Sunday, September 4th.\nWhat else is included in that package?\nFree breakfast and free wifi. It is well within your budget at 4018.16 USD. Would you like me to search packages in the 5000 USD range?\nNo, but can you please give me some flight details on it? I do not like flying out too early in the morning! Also, would I be flying economy or business class?\nDeparture from Sydney is at 12:00pm, arrival in Berlin is at 8:37pm. For the return flight, you would depart Berlin at 3:00am and land in Sydney at 11:37am. This is a business class flight.\n3:00am flight out of Berlin? No way! That means I will have to be at the airport at like midnight! What are the dates for the 8 day package to Brazil? Are the flights any better on that one? And how much is that package?\nThe Brazil package is from August 26th to September 1st at a total of 4006.85 USD. Unfortunately, all return flights to Sydney leave at 3:00 am.\nIs it a business class flight also? Do I get a free breakfast and wifi with that one?\nThe flight is business class and breakfast, wifi and parking are all included in your stay at this 3 star hotel. Can I interest you in a 4 star hotel in Brazil for 5003.33USD and a 8.8/10 guest rating?\nHmmmm that one could be interesting too. A 4 star would be much better. I do not trust 3 star hotels, they are full of cockroaches! Are the dates and flights the same on that package?\nThey are similar. Departure from Sydney is on August 27 at 11:00am and the return flight is on September 3rd at 3:00am. Breakfast, wifi and parking are all included.\nDo you have a flight that departs closer to August 22nd by any chance?\nThe closest I have is the 3 star 8 day package to Manaus we spoke of earlier. The flight is on August 26th.\nHow much is the the 4 star rated hotel to Brazil? Was that one on a business class flight also?\nThe 4 star package to Campinas, Brazil is 5003.33 USD, this includes business class flights.\nThis sounds like the perfect getaway, Brazil is about as far as I can get from Sydney!
