['Hey there!\nGood morning! How may I help you?\nI’ve been tasked with booking my own little Brady bunch a dandy tripadoodle the end of this summer :smile: There’s me, my wife, and 7 little angels. We would like to check out our options in Mexico City, leaving from Munich, with a budget of 12600.\nI would love to help you with that! The first package I can offer you is a 7 day stay at Hotel Tropic which is close to the beach and shopping. It would be from September 2nd to 7th. Would those dates work for you?\nWow, yippee! That’s a stupendous sounding vacation! Oh yes, those dates are just fine. I guess I should’ve told ya earlier but we are free to travel from August 30th until September 12th.\nGreat! Should I book this one for you or would you like to consider more options?\nI’ve gotta be good and thorough though, this trip is going to set the standard for all our family getaways to come. What else is available?\nAnother option for your family would be to spend 7 days at the 3.5 star Exalted Willow Resort & Suites. This one is also close to the beach and would come out to 10688.56USD.\nOh, so how many stars was the Hotel Tropic spot you first mentioned?\nThat one had 3 stars.\nOk! Now, I have another destination that I’m interested.. are there any packages available if we went to San Diego?\nIn San Diego I can offer you a week long package at a 2.5 star hotel, Majestic Mountain Inn. It includes free breakfast, wifi and parking. The total cost of this holiday would be 10956.9USD.\nOk.. well, we are also thinking about visiting Essen as that’s where my wife’s family is from. Could you tell me anything about packages to Essen from Munich ?\nEssen would be a much cheaper destination. I have an 8 day holiday package at the Relaxation Hotel available. You could fly in business class for 3702.62USD.\nHmm yes, of course. Far more affordable to travel domestically. I think Mexico City would be far more fun that seeing the crusty in-laws… Let’s go back to those packages. I think I’d like to book Exalted in Mexico City. It sounds very exotic and beautiful.\nSure! Would you like to go ahead with a booking or would you prefer if I check for more options?\nLet’s do it :smile:\n********************************Hi I am from Minneapolis and I am looking for a 5 day get away for the upcoming long weekend\nIs this a trip for one adult?\nyes just lonely ole me\nCan you please give me the dates you will be free to travel?\nI have to leave on Friday Sept 2nd and I have 5 days off\nI can offer you 4 day vacations to Calgary or Burlington.

What do you have close to a museum?\nFor the days you requested, none of the hotels available are close to a museum. However, we do have a 2.5 star hotel in the heart of the city.\nHow much is this place in Burlington?\nYour stay at Excursion Motel would be 612.32USD. The rating, if you would like to know, if 2.5\nAnd Calgary?\nThe Calgary package is 290.10USD and 4 stars\nSo it is cheaper even though it is a 4 star?\nYes it is!\nwhat else do you have in Calgary?\nThe 4 star hotel which is the Amusement is the only one available for the weekend. The only option I can offer you would be to upgrade to a business class ticket which would increase the cost to 387.34USD\nwhat is it close to?\nIt is close to a university\nanything else included in the price?\nThis hotel offers free wifi and parking\nno breakfast?\nNo, there is no breakfast included in the price\nso you only have the 2.5 star hotel in Burlington and the 4 star hotel available in Calgary.

Have a good afternoon!\n***********************Hello. I am a deeply tormented children’s writer and I need to get away to Lima to write my upcoming book, The Little Engine That Let Everyone Down.

Thank you anyway \n**************************************how do you! So how does this work? I am not too good with technology, I am more of a pen and paper kind of guy\nThat is ok :slightly_smiling_face: I will guide you through it. I’m here to help you find the best vacation packages to fit your needs. Maybe we can start by you telling me where you are located and where you would like to explore travel options to.\nOk thank you! I live in San Juan and I have two destinations in mind. The first one is Chicago.\nGreat, do you have a window of travel dates that you are limited to?\nNo, but I am really hoping to be gone for 10 days.\nWould 11 days be ok? I have a trip from Aug 31-Sept 10 in Chicago leaving from San Juan for 1324.90USD\nAn extra day should be ok. For how many people is that price?\nThat’s just one adult. How many of you will travel?\nMe, my wife Penny and Johnny my son.\nFantastic. And could you tell me what your budget is?\n1700, I wish I could spend more but I am a writer and my last book was a total flop you know. I am travelling to work on my book so if you could find places that were calm that would be really nice. I need this one to be a masterpiece!\nOk! Well sadly I cannot find you a package in Chicago for that budget, so perhaps you could tell me your other destination possibility and we can explore your options there.\nOk, the other place I was thinking of is Baltimore\nFor just a little more than your budget I can book you 13 days at the Countryside Inn. This would cost 1747.67USD for the three of you and you would be in Baltimore from Sept 2-14.\nIs that the only option for Baltimore?\nYou could spend 8 days at the Countryside Resort in Baltimore for 1805.69USD.\nOk well I really need this getaway so I suppose an extra 50$ and 3 days will not hurt. Can you tell me more about the place?\nSure! It’s 3 stars, near a park for little Jonny, and has a guest rating of 8.69. The hotel has free wifi, free breakfast, and free parking as well :slightly_smiling_face:\nIs it booked then?\nI can go ahead and book it if you are ready!\nYes please!\nConsider it done then :slightly_smiling_face:\nAmazing, thank you! Now all that is left to do is for me to write a bestseller! And pack of course\n**************************Hi, I would like to go to Seattle from Manaus.
